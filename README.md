User Story:
This is a game of memory. The board will have four sections each with their own color. The player will initiate the game by pressing the start button. Four or more sections will light up. The player has to remember the order in which they lit up and recreate it as they pressing on them. If they get it right, they will get an alert that says they won the round and earned a point. If they do not, they will get an alert that says they lost the round, will not proceed to the next, and did not earn a point.  When they have 10 points, they win and the game is over. If at any point they decide they don't like the sequence they can press a reshuffle button and get a new sequence.
